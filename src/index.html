          <p>
            The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don’t really need any special gear, you can probably get
            away with things you already have. Let’s start with clothing. A typical mistake hiking beginners make is
            wearing jeans and regular clothes, which will get heavy and chafe wif they get sweaty or wet.

          <p>
            To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it’s raining, throw them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read over the
            guide, study the map, and have a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my next landmark is as I
            hike. For example, I’ll read the guide and know that say, in a mile, I make a right turn at the junction..
